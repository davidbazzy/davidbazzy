# 👋 Hi, I’m David

I’m a **Backend Engineer** with experience building **high-throughput Order Management Systems (OMS)** and **Risk Reporting Tools**.

I'm currently focused on bridging **TradFi and crypto infrastructure**: applying **execution and market structure patterns** to **institutional crypto platforms** (particularly **Solana**), and exploring how **blockchain-native concepts** like **instant settlement** and **automated reconciliation** can transform **traditional post-trade operations**

## ⚙️ Core Technical Skills

**Languages**
- Java (expert)  
- Python (foundational / scripting)  

## 🔑 Crypto Focus

I’ve been **crypto-native since 2017** as an investor and trader, and more recently as a **builder**.

My interest in digital assets comes from the **speed, transparency, and accessibility** of blockchain-based systems — and how they reshape execution, settlement, and market structure.

Current focus:
- **Solana ecosystem** - building trading analysis tool for memecoin trading (Solana Wallet Tracker)  
- Applying OMS and execution concepts to crypto markets
